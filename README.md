## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac
- [BlackHole 2ch](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) (optional fallback for macOS 13–14.3 or manual BlackHole mode)
- 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)

### Installation

#### ✅ Recommended: Homebrew — no manual Gatekeeper step

```bash
brew trust denzam/systemeq
brew install --cask denzam/systemeq/systemeq
```

The Cask removes the macOS quarantine attribute during installation, so the
app opens without the manual Gatekeeper confirmation required by the DMG.
The app remains ad-hoc signed and is not notarized.

> **Why `brew trust`?** Since Homebrew 6.0, third-party taps must be trusted
> explicitly before Homebrew will load them, and there is no way for a tap
> owner to grant that on your behalf. Without it you get
> `Refusing to load cask ... from untrusted tap`. It is a one-time command per
> machine. On Homebrew 5 and older, skip it — the command does not exist there.

#### Option 2: Download DMG or ZIP — manual Gatekeeper confirmation required

1. Download the latest `.dmg` or `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/denzam/SystemEQ-for-Mac/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag `SystemEQ for Mac.app` to `/Applications`
3. **First launch (one of):**
   - **Right-click the app → Open → Open** in the confirmation dialog, or
   - Try to launch, then open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**, or
   - From Terminal:
     ```bash
     xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/SystemEQ for Mac.app"
     ```
4. On macOS 14.4+, leave Audio Backend set to **Automatic**. Install BlackHole only if SystemEQ offers the fallback or you select BlackHole mode yourself.

> The app is **ad-hoc signed** (free, self-signed) — not notarized with an
> Apple Developer ID. Gatekeeper therefore shows a warning on first launch.
> This is intentional: SystemEQ stays free and does not require the paid
> Apple Developer Program. The Gatekeeper steps above are one-time only.

#### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denzam/SystemEQ-for-Mac.git
cd "SystemEQ for Mac"
open "SystemEQ for Mac.xcodeproj"
# Press Cmd+R to build and run
```

### Setup Guide

1. **Use Automatic routing** (recommended on macOS 14.4+):
   - Open SystemEQ → Settings → Audio Backend
   - Leave it set to **Automatic**
   - Select your speakers or headphones in Routing, then click **Enable EQ**
   - SystemEQ captures audio natively; do not change the macOS system output

2. **Use BlackHole only when needed** (macOS 13–14.3, fallback, or manual selection):
   - Install [BlackHole 2ch](https://existential.audio/blackhole/) and restart SystemEQ
   - In Routing, select BlackHole as input and your speakers/headphones as output
   - Set **BlackHole 2ch** as the macOS System Output, then click **Enable EQ**

3. **Apply EQ Preset**:
   - AutoEQ tab → Search your headphone model
   - Click "⚡ Quick Import"
   - Or manually adjust bands in the Equalizer tab

## 🛠️ Architecture

```text
macOS 14.4+: System Audio → Process Tap → vDSP Biquad EQ → Physical Output

Fallback:     System Audio → BlackHole 2ch → vDSP Biquad EQ → Physical Output
```

**No Multi-Output Device is needed.** Automatic routing uses the native macOS engine when available; BlackHole is retained for compatibility and fallback.

### Technical Details

- **CoreAudioEngine**: Low-level AUHAL dual I/O, lock-free ring buffer
- **BiquadFilterVDSP**: vDSP batch processing, 5-10× faster than scalar
- **SPSCRingBuffer**: Lock-free SPSC buffer with C11 atomics
- **EQDatabase**: SQLite, 18 MB, 8,665 headphone models

## 🎯 Usage

### Equalizer

- Adjust frequency bands with sliders
- Switch between 10-band and 31-band modes
- Save custom presets for quick recall
- Apply auto-preamp to prevent clipping

### AutoEQ Presets

1. Search for your headphone model (8,665 available)
2. Choose a preset (oratory1990, Crinacle, etc.)
3. Click "⚡ Quick Import"
4. Adjust bass boost if needed

### Calibration

1. Run hearing test (31 frequencies)
2. Adjust volume per frequency to match reference
3. Save profile for automatic application
4. Use A/B comparison to test profiles

### Visualizer

- Choose from 4 styles: Spectrum, Waveform, Particles, Psychedelic
- Adjust intensity (0–100%)
- Real-time FFT at 60 FPS

### Room Tuning and Resonance Finder

- Use **Subjective Room Tuning** to tune your room response by ear
- Use **Resonance Finder** to sweep for boomy or ringing frequencies, then create a corrective notch filter

### Output-Specific Presets

In **Settings**, enable **Auto-Switch Preset per Output**. SystemEQ remembers
the preset applied on each physical output and re-applies it when you switch
outputs. You can also enable **Launch at Login** there.

## 🎚️ DAW Compatibility (Reaper, Logic, Ableton, etc.)

SystemEQ processes **system-wide audio output**. DAWs typically bypass the system output and talk directly to your audio interface — so EQ is **not applied** by default.

| Scenario | EQ applied? |
| --- | --- |
| Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music | ✅ Yes |
| DAW → System Output (manual config) | ✅ Yes |
| DAW → Audio Interface directly (typical) | ❌ No |
| DAW monitoring through Scarlett/Focusrite | ❌ No |

### How to use SystemEQ with your DAW

1. In your DAW, set **output device to BlackHole 2ch**
2. SystemEQ applies EQ and forwards audio to your physical output
3. To return to direct monitoring, set DAW output back to your interface

**Reaper:** Options → Preferences → Audio → Device → BlackHole 2ch

**Logic:** Preferences → Audio → Output Device → BlackHole 2ch

**Ableton:** Preferences → Audio → Output Device → BlackHole 2ch

> This adds ~10-20ms extra latency vs direct monitoring. This is an architectural limitation of routing through the BlackHole system driver.

## 📊 Project Status

SystemEQ ships its core EQ, routing, calibration, AutoEQ, output-specific preset, and visualizer features and is actively maintained.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

### `Error: Refusing to load cask ... from untrusted tap`

Homebrew 6.0 will not load a third-party tap until you mark it as trusted, and a
tap owner cannot grant that for you. Run this once per Mac, then install or
upgrade as usual:

```bash
brew trust denzam/systemeq
brew upgrade --cask systemeq   # or: brew install --cask denzam/systemeq/systemeq
```

On Homebrew 5 and older the `trust` command does not exist — skip it.

### Reset EQ or remove a preset

In AutoEQ, **Reset** sets every band in the current 10- or 31-band mode and the
preamp to **0 dB**, clears Bass Boost, and removes the active preset. The **×**
beside the preset name does the same. The flat state survives a restart; the
removed preset is also unassigned from the current output device. Favorites and
presets assigned to other devices remain available. Output Boost and independent
room correction are separate controls and are unchanged by this EQ reset.

For a complete reset, open **Settings → Factory Reset** and confirm. This deletes
all saved settings, preset favorites, device assignments, custom preset state,
visualizer favorites, and calibration/hearing profiles, and disables launch at
login. SystemEQ quits after restoring the physical audio output. Reopen it to
start with factory defaults and onboarding. The bundled AutoEQ library, original
imported files, installed BlackHole driver, and macOS permissions are preserved.

### The app asks for microphone access again after an update

Expected. SystemEQ is ad-hoc signed, so its signature changes with every build
and macOS treats each update as a new app. Grant the permission again in
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone**.

### macOS says the app "cannot be opened"

The app is not notarized — see the Security Notice section below.
Right-click the app → **Open** → confirm, or run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/SystemEQ for Mac.app"
```

Installing through Homebrew avoids this — the Cask clears the flag for you.

### No sound after setup

On macOS 14.4+, first choose **Automatic** in Settings → Audio Backend and enable EQ again. The system output should stay on your physical device. If Automatic falls back or cannot start, install BlackHole and follow the BlackHole setup below.

In **Routing**, select BlackHole as input and your speakers or headphones as
output. Set **BlackHole 2ch** as the macOS System Output, click **Enable EQ**,
and keep SystemEQ running.

### Sound is quieter after switching to BlackHole

macOS stores a separate volume level for each output device. After switching
to BlackHole, raise the system volume with the keyboard volume keys or in
macOS Sound settings.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

- This app is **not sandboxed** (incompatible with CoreAudio/AUHAL virtual audio devices)
- **No telemetry, analytics, or data collection** — all data stays on your Mac
- Only install from official [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/denzam/SystemEQ-for-Mac/releases)
- Ad-hoc signed — right-click → Open on first launch to bypass Gatekeeper

### Security audits

The codebase is audited periodically with automated security scanning. Findings
and their resolution are tracked in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); fixes ship in the
next release and are listed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### EQ editing and A/B comparison

In AutoEQ, **Undo EQ** (`⌘Z`) and **Redo EQ** (`⇧⌘Z`) restore band edits, Bass Boost,
Output Gain, normalization, band-mode changes, preset imports and EQ reset/removal.
A continuous band drag or slider adjustment is one step. History is kept in memory,
limited to 60 steps, and cleared when the output device changes.

**Compare A/B** copies the current EQ into two slots. Select B, change its EQ or load
another preset, then switch between A and B. Each slot keeps its own edit history.
Output Gain stays shared and is outside slot undo during comparison; preamp and EQ differences can still change perceived
loudness. **Keep Current** ends the comparison using the selected slot. Switching
outputs ends the comparison and restores the usual per-device Auto-Switch behavior.

**Settings → Device Profiles** lists connected outputs and saved assignments for
outputs that are disconnected. It shows the preset, band mode, preamp and Bass Boost.
Apply a preset in AutoEQ to assign it to the selected output. Removing the active
assignment with Auto-Switch enabled clears its EQ to 0 dB; other assignments remain.
